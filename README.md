# Photogram Gallery

**Photogram Gallery** is an interactive image gallery that displays images in a 3x3 grid layout. When clicked, the thumbnails enlarge in a modal (popup) view for a more detailed look. This project is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## 🌟 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a clean and simple image gallery that allows users to view images in a grid, with the ability to click on each thumbnail to see it in full size. The gallery is designed to be lightweight, user-friendly, and easily customizable.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Open the Gallery**: To view the gallery, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. **Interacting with Images**:
    - Click on any image in the grid to open it in a modal (popup) view.
    - To close the modal, click the close button (×) located at the top-right of the image.

## 📥 How to Add New Images
1. Place new images inside the `images/` folder within the project directory.
2. Ensure the new images are correctly referenced in the `index.html` file to display them in the gallery.

## 🔧 Customization Options
- **Change Images**: You can modify the images in the `images/` folder or update the image paths in the `index.html` file.
- **Customize Colors**: To change the background color or the red borders, simply edit the `styles.css` file to match your desired colors.
- **Typography**: The font family for the gallery title and captions can be updated by modifying the CSS file.

## 🛠️ Requirements
- The gallery works in all modern web browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, etc.).
- If you'd like to deploy the gallery online, you can use **GitHub Pages**, **Netlify**, or any other hosting platform.

## 🖼️ Live Demo
